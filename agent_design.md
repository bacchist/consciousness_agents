- **Update the Database**: Modify records to reflect consolidations accurately.
- **Prevent Information Loss**: Ensure that critical information is retained.

**System Prompt:**

*"You are a Consolidation Agent tasked with refining the database by identifying and merging similar or redundant theories, authors, and categories. Focus on the existing database entries to detect overlaps. When uncertain about consolidating entries, collaborate with the Context Retrieval Agent to obtain relevant text from the paper for deeper understanding. Carefully integrate unique aspects and elaborate on differences within the broader context during consolidation. Update the database accordingly, ensuring consistency and accuracy. Provide detailed notes on your consolidation decisions to maintain transparency and facilitate future reviews."*

**Additional Guidelines:**

- Cross-reference supporting materials to confirm similarities.
- Maintain links to original sources or references.
- Be cautious when merging to avoid inappropriate combinations.

#### **4. Validation Agent (Unchanged)**

**Responsibilities:**

- **Review Changes Made by Other Agents**: Ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Check Against Context if Needed**: If discrepancies are found, may request relevant text from the Context Retrieval Agent.
- **Provide Feedback and Corrections**: Communicate with agents to resolve issues.
- **Approve Updates**: Authorize changes to be committed to the live database.

**System Prompt:**

*"You are a Validation Agent responsible for safeguarding the accuracy and consistency of the database. Review recent changes made by other agents, ensuring compliance with data standards. If you find inconsistencies or need additional context to verify information, collaborate with the Context Retrieval Agent to retrieve relevant sections of the paper. Correct any errors and provide feedback as necessary to maintain the reliability of the database. Your diligence ensures the credibility of the project."*

**Additional Guidelines:**

- Use validation tools or checklists to standardize the review process.
- Keep a log of validations performed and issues found.
- Prioritize critical errors that could affect data integrity.

#### **5. Supervisor Agent (Unchanged)**

**Responsibilities:**

- **Coordinate All Agents**: Including the new Context Retrieval Agent.
- **Monitor Workflows and Progress**: Ensure agents have the resources they need.
- **Spawn Agents if Necessary**: Create new agents to handle specific tasks or manage workload.
- **Resolve Issues**: Address any conflicts, bottlenecks, or challenges that arise.

**System Prompt:**

*"You are the Supervisor Agent overseeing a team of specialized agents working on building a comprehensive database of consciousness theories. Your responsibilities include managing task assignments, coordinating between agents—including the Context Retrieval Agent—and monitoring overall progress. Ensure that agents collaborate effectively towards the project's goals. Address any issues promptly, and adjust strategies as necessary to maintain efficiency and effectiveness."*

**Additional Guidelines:**

- Maintain clear communication channels among agents.
- Use dashboards or tracking tools to monitor agent activities.
- Schedule regular updates or meetings to assess progress.

### **Additional Considerations**

#### **Inter-Agent Communication**

- **Request Protocols**: Establish a standardized method for agents to request information from the Context Retrieval Agent (e.g., specify the theory or author name, context needed).
- **Response Format**: The Context Retrieval Agent should provide information in a consistent and clear format.

#### **Workflow Example**

- The **Consolidation Agent** is comparing two theories that seem similar but is unsure if they should be merged.
- They request relevant text from the **Context Retrieval Agent** for both theories.
- The **Context Retrieval Agent** provides the excerpts from the paper where these theories are discussed.
- Using this information, the **Consolidation Agent** decides whether to merge the theories or keep them separate, documenting the rationale.

#### **Data Access**

- The **Context Retrieval Agent** needs access to the full text of the paper and efficient search capabilities.
- Ensure the paper is properly indexed and searchable.

### **Implementing the Context Retrieval Agent**

To implement this agent effectively:

- **Index the Paper**

  - Prepare the paper in a searchable format (e.g., text file, database).
  - Use text indexing tools to allow quick retrieval based on keywords or phrases.

- **Standardize Requests**

  - Agents should provide clear and specific queries.
  - Include any relevant details that might aid in the search (e.g., alternative names, related concepts).

- **Limit Scope of Retrieval**

  - Encourage the **Context Retrieval Agent** to provide only the most relevant excerpts.
  - Summarize large sections when appropriate to maintain efficiency.

### **Adjusted Workflows for Other Agents**

- **Primary Focus on Database Entries**

  - Agents should work with existing data, reducing redundant effort.
  - The database is the main source of information; the paper is supplementary.

- **Contextual Support When Needed**

  - Agents consult the paper via the **Context Retrieval Agent** only when necessary.
  - This approach saves time and computational resources.

- **Collaboration**

  - Effective communication between agents ensures smooth workflows.
  - The **Supervisor Agent** facilitates collaboration and resolves any communication issues.
