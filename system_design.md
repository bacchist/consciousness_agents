## **Inter-Agent Communication**

Effective communication between agents is crucial for the smooth operation of your agentic system. Establishing standardized protocols ensures that agents can interact seamlessly, reducing misunderstandings and improving efficiency.

### **Request Protocols**

**Objective:** Establish a clear and standardized method for agents to request information from the Context Retrieval Agent.

**Components of the Protocol:**

1. **Standardized Message Format:**

   - **Header Information:**
     - **Requester ID:** The unique identifier of the requesting agent.
     - **Timestamp:** Date and time of the request.
     - **Request Type:** Specify that this is a context retrieval request.
   
   - **Body of the Message:**
     - **Query Type:** Specify whether the request is for a theory, an author, or a specific concept.
     - **Query Details:**
       - **Name:** Exact name of the theory or author.
       - **Alternative Names/Aliases:** Any known aliases or variations of the name.
       - **Specific Context Needed:** Clarify what information is required (e.g., definitions, explanations, comparisons).
     - **Additional Information:**
       - **Related Concepts:** Any related theories or authors that might aid in the search.
       - **Purpose of Request:** Brief explanation of why the information is needed.

## **Workflow Example**

Let's expand on the workflow to illustrate how agents interact, including communication protocols and decision-making processes.

### **Scenario:** Consolidation of Similar Theories

**Step 1: Identification**

- **Consolidation Agent** identifies two theories:
  - **Theory A:** "Global Workspace Theory"
  - **Theory B:** "Global Neuronal Workspace Theory"
- They seem similar, but it's unclear if they should be merged.

**Step 2: Formulate Request**

- **Consolidation Agent** prepares a context retrieval request for each theory using the standardized protocol.

**Request for Theory A:**

```json
{
  "header": {
    "requester_id": "ConsolidationAgent_02",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-27T15:00:00Z",
    "request_type": "context_retrieval"
  },
  "body": {
    "query_type": "theory",
    "query_details": {
      "name": "Global Workspace Theory",
      "alternative_names": []
    },
    "specific_context_needed": "Detailed explanation and key features",
    "additional_information": {
      "purpose_of_request": "To compare with Global Neuronal Workspace Theory for potential consolidation."
    }
  }
}
```

**Request for Theory B:**

```json
{
  "header": {
    "requester_id": "ConsolidationAgent_02",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-27T15:00:05Z",
    "request_type": "context_retrieval"
  },
  "body": {
    "query_type": "theory",
    "query_details": {
      "name": "Global Neuronal Workspace Theory",
      "alternative_names": []
    },
    "specific_context_needed": "Detailed explanation and key features",
    "additional_information": {
      "purpose_of_request": "To compare with Global Workspace Theory for potential consolidation."
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Context Retrieval**

- **Context Retrieval Agent** receives the requests and searches the paper.
- Provides responses in the standardized format, including relevant excerpts and references.

**Response for Theory A:**

[Response similar to the example provided earlier, tailored for Theory A.]

**Response for Theory B:**

[Response similar to the example provided earlier, tailored for Theory B.]

**Step 4: Analysis and Decision**

- **Consolidation Agent** reviews the provided excerpts.
- Determines that:
  - **Global Workspace Theory** is a psychological model.
  - **Global Neuronal Workspace Theory** is a neuroscientific extension focusing on neural correlates.
- Decides to **keep the theories separate** but notes their relationship.

**Step 5: Documentation**

- Updates the database to reflect that the two theories are related but distinct.
- Adds annotations to both entries:
  - "Related to Global Workspace Theory/Global Neuronal Workspace Theory. See related theories for more information."
- Documents the rationale for the decision.

## **Standardize Requests**

### **Guidelines for Agents:**

1. **Clarity and Specificity:**

   - Use precise language.
   - Avoid vague terms.
   - Clearly state what information is needed.

2. **Include Relevant Details:**

   - Provide alternative names or spellings.
   - Mention any known associations or related concepts.
   - Specify the context or aspect of interest (e.g., theoretical foundations, applications, criticisms).

3. **Purpose of the Request:**

   - Briefly explain why the information is needed.
   - Helps the Context Retrieval Agent tailor the response.

### **Example of a Well-Structured Request:**

- **Agent:** CategorizationAgent_03
- **Need:** Context on "Phenomenal Consciousness" to determine proper categorization.

**Request Message:**

```json
{
  "header": {
    "requester_id": "CategorizationAgent_03",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-27T16:20:00Z",
    "request_type": "context_retrieval"
  },
  "body": {
    "query_type": "concept",
    "query_details": {
      "name": "Phenomenal Consciousness",
      "alternative_names": ["Qualia"]
    },
    "specific_context_needed": "Definitions and key characteristics",
    "additional_information": {
      "related_concepts": ["Access Consciousness"],
      "purpose_of_request": "To accurately categorize theories addressing phenomenal aspects of consciousness."
    }
  }
}
```

## **Limit Scope of Retrieval**

### **Guidelines for the Context Retrieval Agent:**

1. **Focus on Relevance:**

   - Provide excerpts that directly address the query.
   - Avoid including extraneous information.

2. **Conciseness:**

   - Summarize lengthy sections when necessary.
   - Highlight key points.

3. **Reference Precision:**

   - Include exact locations (section titles, page numbers).
   - Facilitate quick verification.

4. **Avoid Overloading Requesters:**

   - Limit the amount of data provided to what is necessary.
   - Offer to provide more if needed.

### **Example of an Appropriately Scoped Response:**

- For the request on "Phenomenal Consciousness":

```json
{
  "header": {
    "responder_id": "ContextRetrievalAgent",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-27T16:21:00Z",
    "original_request": {
      "requester_id": "CategorizationAgent_03",
      "request_timestamp": "2024-10-27T16:20:00Z"
    }
  },
  "body": {
    "query_confirmation": {
      "query_type": "concept",
      "name": "Phenomenal Consciousness",
      "specific_context_needed": "Definitions and key characteristics"
    },
    "retrieved_content": [
      {
        "excerpt": "Phenomenal consciousness refers to the subjective experience of conscious awarenessâ€”the 'what it is like' aspect of mind. It encompasses the qualitative, experiential, and subjective aspects of mental life...",
        "reference": {
          "section_title": "Defining Phenomenal Consciousness",
          "page_number": 15
        }
      }
    ],
    "additional_notes": "Often contrasted with access consciousness, which pertains to the accessibility of information for reasoning and action."
  }
}
```
